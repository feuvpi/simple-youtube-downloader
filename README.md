<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![Alt text](Initial-interface.png)

A minimalistic desktop application built with Python utilizing the Pytube library. It allows
users to download both audio and video files from YouTube. The app offers a fast and reliable way to download YouTube
videos, with the added ability to choose between downloading video or audio only format.

The user interface is simple, with a command line prompts for the user to enter the YouTube video link, and select the
desired format (audio or video), after which the download process begins. The app also has a built-in progress bar to
keep track of the download progress.

This project is a great example of how the Pytube library can be used to develop a functional YouTube downloader. It
demonstrates the use of Python for building command-line interface applications, and the ability to work with external
libraries.

- You need to install the tkinter library, it is a standard library of python, if you have python installed it is
  already available.
- Run the main.py file, with python interpreter
- For distribution you can use pyinstaller, by running pyinstaller -w main.py
